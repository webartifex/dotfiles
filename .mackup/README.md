# Custom Configuration for `mackup`

This folder contains various **config** files
    to include all kinds of files in the [`mackup backup`](https://github.com/lra/mackup).
Their format is described [here](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-almost-any-file-or-directory).

`mackup` is used to synchronize (dot) files the general public should *not* see.
